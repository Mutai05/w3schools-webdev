    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <h3>The Concept of Data Types</h3>

    <p>When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      let x = 16 + "Volvo";
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>

    <p id="demo1"></p>

    <script>
      let y = "Volvo" + 16;
      document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = y;
    </script>

    <p>
      JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:
    </p>

    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <script>
      let b = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
      document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = b;
    </script>

    <p>In the second example, since the first operand is a string, all operands are treated as strings.</p>
    <p id="demo3"></p>

    <script>
      let c = "Volvo" + 16 + 4 + 4;
      document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = c;
    </script>

    <h3>JavaScript Types are Dynamic</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data
      types:
    </p>

    <p id="demo4"></p>

    <script>
      let d; // x is undefined
      d = 5; // Now x is a Number
      d = "John"; // Now x is a String

      document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = d;
    </script>
    <h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>
    <p>Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:</p>

    <p id="strings"></p>

    <script>
      let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";
      let carName2 = "Volvo XC60";

      document.getElementById("strings").innerHTML = carName1 + "<br>" + carName2;
    </script>

    <p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:</p>

    <p id="strings1"></p>

    <script>
      let answer1 = "It's alright";
      let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
      let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

      document.getElementById("strings1").innerHTML = answer1 + "<br>" + answer2 + "<br>" + answer3;
    </script>

    <h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>
    <p>All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).</p>
    <p>Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:</p>

    <p id="numbers"></p>

    <script>
      let x1 = 34.0;
      let x2 = 34;
      let x3 = 3.14;

      document.getElementById("numbers").innerHTML = x1 + "<br>" + x2 + "<br>" + x3;
    </script>
  </body>
